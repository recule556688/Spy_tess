## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This bot is designed to join Discord voice channels, transcribe audio in real-time, and respond to specific keywords with predefined actions. It uses the Whisper model for transcription and can handle multiple channels across different servers.

## üí≠ How it Works <a name = "working"></a>

The bot connects to a voice channel, records audio, and uses the Whisper model to transcribe the audio. It detects specific keywords in the transcription and performs actions such as sending messages or links in response.

### Auto-Join Feature

The bot can automatically join voice channels when users enter, start transcribing, and leave when the channel is empty. This feature was inspired by the strategic maneuvers of the Cold War between Russia and the USA, with a little wink to China for their innovative surveillance techniques. üòâ

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the bot, you have two options: auto-join and manual commands.

### Auto-Join Feature

The bot can automatically join a voice channel when users enter, start transcribing, and leave when the channel is empty. This feature ensures seamless operation without manual intervention. To activate auto-join, use:

```
/activate_auto_join
```

To deactivate, use:

```
/deactivate_auto_join
```

### Manual Commands

For manual control, you can use the following commands:

- **Join and Start Transcribing**: 
  ```
  /join
  /start_transcribing
  ```

- **Set Channels**: You can set the transcription and response channels using:
  ```
  /set_transcription_channel
  /set_response_channel
  ```

These commands allow you to manage the bot's behavior and channel settings manually.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
python3, pip, Discord account
```

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

```
git clone https://github.com/recule556688/Spy_tess.git
cd Spy_tess
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration <a name = "configuration"></a>

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your environment variables. This file should contain your Discord bot token:

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
```

Replace `your_discord_bot_token_here` with your actual Discord bot token. This token is essential for authenticating your bot with the Discord API.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
